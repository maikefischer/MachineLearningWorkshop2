The goal is *not* to build the most accurate model but rather understand what steps are involved to get to your first minimal viable model. Building a good machine learning model is an iterative process, this workshop is a good starting point for engineers who want to get a first try at practical machine learning."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"tp3pfMtDF8Ep","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Business case\n","\n","Every machine learning project starts with a business problem.
